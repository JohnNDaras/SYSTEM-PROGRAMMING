# SYSTEM-PROGRAMMING

**<p align=center>1.Process Management and Communication in Unix Environment**
<br>

This project involves creating processes for monitoring directory changes, communicating through pipes and named pipes, and performing URL searches in text files. The manager coordinates workers, restarting them as needed, and oversees the extraction and tallying of URLs. Processes are terminated by the user, initiated with Ctrl+C for the manager, ensuring the orderly shutdown of all associated processes.


**<p align=center>2.Concurrent Directory Copying in Unix: Efficient Server-Client Communication with Threaded Processing**
<br>

This project involves system programming in a Unix environment, focusing on concurrent directory copying between a server and multiple clients. The server, dataServer, uses threads for communication and file copying, employing a thread pool to handle parallel tasks efficiently. The client, remoteClient, connects to the server, receives file metadata and contents, and recreates the directory locally. Command-line arguments configure server and client settings, facilitating seamless and efficient file transfers between systems.
