# SYSTEM-PROGRAMMING

**<p align=center>Process Management and Communication in Unix Environment**
<br>

This project involves creating processes for monitoring directory changes, communicating through pipes and named pipes, and performing URL searches in text files. The manager coordinates workers, restarting them as needed, and oversees the extraction and tallying of URLs. Processes are terminated by the user, initiated with Ctrl+C for the manager, ensuring the orderly shutdown of all associated processes.
